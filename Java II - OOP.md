# Java Part 2: Object-oriented Programming

### Topics
- Classes - Encapsulation & Abstraction
- Refactoring Towards an Object-oriented Design
- Inheritance & Polymorphism
- Interfaces


## Introduction 

### Programming Paradigms

Two most popular programming paradigms these days:
- Functional
- Object-oriented 

Other paradigms incluede:

- Procedural
- Event-driven
- Logic
- Aspect-oriented

### Benefits of OOP

- Reduce complexity
- Easier maintance
- Code reuse $\rightarrow$ Faster development

## Classes

### Topics

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Constructors
- Getters / Setters
- Method Overloading

A class is a template / a blueprint for creating new objects, while an object is an instance of a class that it was created upon.

### Memory Allocation in Java

Stack

- Primitive variables
- Reference variables
- Local variables
- Pointers to the objects on the heap memory, i.e. memory addresses

Heap

- Objects


Deallocation

- Memory in stack is cleaned up when the method returns.
- Garbge collection is automatically done in Java to clean up the heap memory.

### Encapsulation

Main idea:
Bundle the data and the methods that operate on the data in a single unit.
