## 1 - Landing Page Project

A responsive landing page for TinDog (an arbitrary app), inlcuding:
- Title section
- Navigation bar
- Features section; icons color changes when mouse hovers
- Testimonials section with carousel slides
- Pricing section
- Call to Action section
- Footer section

ALL COMPONENTS ARE RESPONSIVE TO SCREEN SIZE!


Building from stratch, I made use of the following tools: 
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Boostrap 4

### Reference:
This project is a part of of the online course:
[The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy.
With previous programming experience, this course is very helpful for me to understand the web development tasks and the toolkit avaliable.
The course introduces both the front-end and back-end development, with lots of hands-on practices. The tools includes:

- HTML5, CSS3, JS

## 2 - More to come!
