# Machine Learning

Machine learning is:

- Models from training data
- Optimization & Regression
- A combination of linear algebra, optimisation theory, statistics, and more ...
- Human guided, e.g.
	- Questions to addressed
	- Data to be collected, inputs / outputs of ML models
	- Architecture

Machine learning is **NOT**:

- Magic
- Just neural networks (NN)

In some sense, machine learning is an optimazation problem, in which we optimize the underlying models with the data we collected.
