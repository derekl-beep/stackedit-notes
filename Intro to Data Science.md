# Machine Learning

### Overview

Machine learning is:

- Models from training data
- Optimization & Regression
- A combination of linear algebra, optimisation theory, statistics, and more ...
- Human guided, e.g.
	- Questions to addressed
	- Data to be collected, inputs / outputs of ML models
	- ML architecture

Machine learning is **NOT**:

- Magic
- Just neural networks (NN)

In some sense, machine learning is an optimazation problem, in which we optimize the underlying models with the data we collected.

### Goals

# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)


SVD is:

- Data reduction
- Data-driven generalisation of Fourier transform (FFT)
- "Tailored" to specific problems
- Simple and interpretable linear algebra

SVD can solve:

- $Ax=b$, for non-squared $A$ regression
- basis PCA 
- correlations

Real-world applications include:

- Google's PageRank
- Facebook's facial recognition
- Netflix's recommendation system
