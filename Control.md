## Linear System Theory

Linear systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)

$$
\dot{x}=Ax
$$

, where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector,
 and  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is the system matrix.


The basic solution is

$$
x(t) = e^{At}x(0)
$$

, where $e^{At}=I+tA+\frac{t^2}{2!}A^2+\frac{t^3}{3!}A^3+...$. However, this infinite sum of matrices are numerically difficult.
